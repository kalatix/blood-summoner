How yeh get ta here? Not a fisherman by th'looks a yeh. Waves too rough round these parts anyhow. An' with the monsters vicious as they are wont ta these days, it's a wonder nobody travels at all. If yeh aren't no fisherman, are yeh lost?

COLLEGE
Never heard a the college? Yeh must be from right far off. Thar's a place ta study what's left a the world far east a here. Not sure I could say exactly where, but I know they study the only book that matters anymore. The Dark Codex.

ASK NAME
Name's Father Trimble, meself. Ain't much of a father now though. 'Erebody near up an' died in my parts. All my church is gone, save me. Loved 'em ta the last of the light. No, I'm travelin meself â€“ lookin fer somethin that I ain't sure even exists.

Anyway, I've no manners, me! What's it they call yeh by?

LEAVE
Stay safe and sane, young traveler! Hope yeh find wha' yer lookin fer.
